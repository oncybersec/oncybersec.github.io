<p>I created an enumeration cheat sheet, which I recently uploaded to GitHub. I used this cheat sheet for conducting enumeration during my OSCP journey. Additionally, this cheat sheet contains commands and tools that I used while preparing for the OSCP using platforms like Vulnhub and Hack the Box. Some of these commands are based on the commands executed by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon" target="_blank">Autorecon</a>, which is a network reconnaissance tool that automates the enumeration of services. The OSCP enumeration cheat sheet can be found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/oncybersec/oscp-enumeration-cheat-sheet" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
